1. What is a Variable ?<br>
Variables are containers for storing data values.<br><hr>
2. What is a DataType ?<br>
 A variable in Java must be a specified data type.<br>
 Data types are divided into two groups:<br>
    - Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
    - Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes<br><hr>
3. What is TypeCasting ?<br>
    Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.<br>
    There are two types of casting:
    - Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size <i>byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double</i>
    - Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type <i>double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte</i><br><hr>

5. What is a Modifier ?<br>
    The public keyword is an access modifier, meaning that it is used to set the access level for classes, attributes, methods and constructors.<br>
    We divide modifiers into two groups:
    - Access Modifiers - controls the access level
    - Non-Access Modifiers - do not control access level, but provides other functionality<br>
    
    |Modifiers|Description|
    |---|---|
    public |The code is accessible for all classes|
    private	|The code is only accessible within the declared class|
    protected	|The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses|
    default |The code is only accessible in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier|
